# Caesars-Cipher-Problem-Solution
One of final freeCodeCamp projects for getting Certificate

Problem Explanation:

 Write a function, which will take a string encoded with Caesar cipher as a parameter and decode it.
The one used here is ROT13 where the value of the letter is shifted by 13 places. e.g. ‘A’ <-> ‘N’, ‘T’ <-> ‘G’. Shift it back 13 positions, such that ‘N’ <-> ‘A’.

1. rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to FREE CODE CAMP.
2. rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to FREE PIZZA!
3. rot13("SERR YBIR?") should decode to FREE LOVE?
4. rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.") should decode to THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
